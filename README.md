# Computational Genomics Final Project #

In this project, we are proposing a genome-wide associate study (GWAS) to determine single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with HGPCa. After finding these SNPs significantly associated with HGPCa, we will build a classification engine using those SNPS to predict patients who are significantly at risk of developing HGPCa

For a detailed understanding of the study, see the proposal attached to this repo.
