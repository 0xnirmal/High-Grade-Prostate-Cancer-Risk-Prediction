# Computational Genomics Final Project #

In this project, we are proposing a genome-wide associate study (GWAS) to determine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with HGPCa. We also plan on building a classification engine to predict patients who are significantly at risk of developing HGPCa. 

For a detailed understanding of the study, see the proposal attached to this repo.
